Software developers are the creative force behind computer programs of all kinds.
 They design and write the code used to build everything from operating systems 
 to apps to video games. 

In this role, you may be involved with every stage of the software 
development process, from figuring out what users need and how they'll use 
the software to rolling out a completed application. You may sometimes work with 
computer programmers, 
although many developers complete all the coding themselves.
